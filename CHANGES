Changes to version 0.0-1
o Created package with all latest code

Version 0.0-2
o Recreated package completely

Changes to version 0.0-3 

	o Fixed a bug in reynolds, it needs some stray integers stripped out
	(old Fortran something) - comments in the code show how to
	replicate the test output from the site.  o Added capability
	for gzipped files to reynolds, as well as "data" option to
	return sst, ice, err, land or water.
	
	o Added k0 attenuation offset to find.init - seems to perform
	better.

	o Fixed a bug! in mkTempMask - it was using only the
	initialized Reynolds dataset.


Changes to version 0.0-4
	
	o incorporated new functions for diagnostics

Changes to version 0.0-5
	
	o changed defaults in model.utils to avoid require(rgdal) most
	of the time

Changes to version 0.0-6
	
	o fixed some bugs (not very well) in mkLookup and
	logp.behavioural


Changes to version 0.0-7
	
	o Added function findSegments

Changes to version 0.0-8
	
	o Changed operation of start.x and start.z in solar.model -
	default is they are not passed in, but initialize occurs after
	
	o fetch.topo now uses rgdal to read an ESRI FLT surface
 

Changes to version 0.0.9
	o I'm testing automatic Subversion updating to R repository

Changes to version 0.0.10
	o Removed model.utils and put it all in solar.model

	o mkCalibration now allows a single segment
	
	o init.x.diag - added function to initialize off running
	intersections of large logp values (not the best function yet,
	needs some fixing in terms of naming etc.)

	o metropolis now reports on progress
	
	o position.logp has some changes in that I've added an S3
	class for imaging the array
	
	o show.segment now has "..." to pass in graphics options
	
	o solar.model can now put a larger variance on light levels
	  outside a given range, this is specified either by light or
	  elevation "ekstrom" arguments
	  
	o solar.model now has support for "distance" as well as speed
	model - the arguments have become behav, behav.mean and
	behav.sigma
		
	o solar.model also accepts a proj4 string, and creates
	distance functions appropriately - km units are assumed
	
	

Changes to version 0.0-17

	o restructured package with documentation, the following list
	shows the grouping of functions in doc, sometimes also in the
	R files

Changes to version 0.0-25
	
	o Fixed missing transform function from solar.model (thanks to
	David Pinaud)
	
	
Changes to version 0.0-26
	
	o Fixed a bad mistake from the last build in solar.model
	
Changes to version 0.0-27
	
	o Updated position.logp to more sensibly allow quantile
	probability control (new prob arg)
        
        o Removed fast.pmax and fast.pmin from solar/satellite.model,
        replaced by pmax.int, pmin.int
        
        o Replaced speed.dist, speed.mean and speed.sd arguments in
        satellite.model with behav.dist, behav.mean and behav.sd to
        match solar.model
        
        o Fixed broken checks in solar.model that resulted in worrying
        warning message about logical to double type conversion.
        
        o Added proj.string to satellite.model
        
        o Added transformation capacity to satellite.model
        
        o Fixed an embarassing error in POLAR that caused a disparity
        between the values from elevation() and the astro() functions
        ported from Montenbruck and Pfleger (1994).  
	Thanks to Nick.Ellis@csiro.au for the report.  2009-05-29
